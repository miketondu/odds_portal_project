# odds_portal_project
Machine Learning project focused on utilizing historical betting odds and match results for smaller gambling markets such as the Professional Bolivian Football League. The result of this project has a average **66% accuracy** predicting home team wins, resulting in a positive ROI of up to 30% on simulated seasons

The data was scraped from oddsportal.com using webscraper.io and python's selenium package

The project consists of 3 notebooks:

#### 1. Cleaning data and creating basic features from the scraped strings in the raw dataset

#### 2. Feature engineering and visualization

#### 3. Supervised learning modelling and retroactively simulating bets on historical matches using the predicted results obtained
